# Introduction
Developers are no longer unfamiliar with the Restful API. Using the HTTP protocol, we may effortlessly communicate with other applications by using Restful API.... So, let's start a new Rest API with Spring boot.

Wait.... Before starting, we have to setup environments as a Java backend developers 👨🏻‍💻:
1. Java - [SDK Manager](https://sdkman.io/) is recommended
2. Maven or Gradle
3. Code IDE - [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/) is recommended

Okay! The few things above are enough to get start... Let's go 🚀

# Getting started
- In this article, I am going to using Maven
- Going to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) and generating a new Spring project with following the dependencies:
    - Spring Web
    - Lombok

- Opening the downloaded project with your IDE

Alternative, if you are using `IntelliJ Ultimate IDE`, it's easy to create a Spring boot project on your machine

Then, create

## Okay, then, time to coding ... 👨‍💻
